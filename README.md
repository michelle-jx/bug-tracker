# Bug Tracker

## Description

This app will allow users to track issues and feature requests. 
2 types of user accounts: admin and dev level. 
Admins can view all available tickets, while devs can only see tickets assigned to them. They are also able to give devs admin-level privileges.

## Main Functionality

Full CRUD capability for tickets. Since it would be better business practice to mark projects as "resolved", there is no explicit "delete" function for better logging of past issues. 

Users can navigate to view all projects. 


## Stretch Goals

Interactivity with external APIs such as Jira, Slack, Google Keep.
